### Overview : 

The user can select one of 2 modes (random mode or essay mode) after which an appropriate test is generated.

The user can attempt this test and upon completion they will be presented with relevant stats such as **accuracy** and **typing speed (Words per minute)**.

In the settings panel the user can specify how the essay text is to be formated/cleaned by the application before a test is generated. <br>
for example punctuations and capital letters can be removed.

There are a few novelty features such as enabling **bionic reading**


### Modes :

1. **Random mode** : 

    In this mode the user can select a word count and the application will generate a test containing the specified amount of words.

2. **Essay mode** :

    In this mode the user is expected to supply an essay that they wish to study, the application will generate a test based on the given essay.


### How are the stats calculated?

- Speed (WPM) : (`Number of correct keystrokes` / 5) / `Time taken`

    - The number of correct keystrokes is divided by 5 because on average a typical English word consists of 5 letters

- Accuracy : (`Number of correct keystrokes` / `Total number of keystrokes`) * 100

The demos are not a representation of my actual typing speed. My excuse for the horrible performance is that I was too busy thinking about the recording ....

My average typing speed on MonkeyType is around 71 WPM
